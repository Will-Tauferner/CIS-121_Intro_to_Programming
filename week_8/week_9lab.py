#The first method that many classes have is called a constructor, which defines the way the object is created
#The constructor can create instance variable to hold the values of an instance of the object class.  

#In Python, the constructor is called __init__().

#ALl methods (in python) require one special parameter (the first parameter) which refers to the object that is being created.
