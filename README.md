# CIS-121_Intro_to_Programming
Projects Completed in CIS-121 Labs

Week 3:
Outcome 3: Create programs utilizing conditional logic.
standard 3.1 – Apply conditional expressions to control the flow of a simple program.

standard 3.2 – Apply conditional expressions to control the flow of a intermediate program.

standard 3.3 – Use nested conditionals and understand their effect on program flow.

standard 3.4 – Demonstrate standard during lab
week 4:
Outcome:Use iterative constructs to repeat code execution based on conditions or ranges
standard 4.1 – Use for loops with ranges, strings, and lists to iterate over sequences.
standard 4.2 – Implement iteration with indeterminate number of operations.
standard 4.3 – Use nested loops and understand their effect on program flow.
standard 4.4 – Demonstrate standard during lab.
standard 4.5 – See project rubric

Outcome 5: Define and invoke userdefined functions with appropriate parameters and return values
standard 5.1 Write custom functions with a single output and one or fewer arguments
standard 5.2 Write custom functions with a single output and more than one arguments
